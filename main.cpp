// NOTES:
/* following our header file i made the transaction class, and  put Borrow
and Return classes at the bottom as comment blocks. Wasn't sure if we were
having them be a transaction or a command */

/* also made file names lowercase to follow the usual format, then uppercase
for actual class definition in the file */

/* going to be looking at ways we can compiile in here */
